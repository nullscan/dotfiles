The Pierced Spirit - Iced Earth

Gaze upon me now
A desperate soul for all time
Bound forever to this barren land... desolate
My spirit has been pierced
So crucify if you must
But just recall it's in your creed
Not to judge
Crucify me, I am the pierced spirit
Crucify me, for I know that you must
You must
