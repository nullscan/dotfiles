Kingdom Come - Perfect 'o'

L. wolf, r. steier, j. b. frank

Passion rises between us,
Babe
Wanna take you in my arms
Slide your body down on
Mine
Come and move me like
Ocean waves
Ooh, let go
I hear you moan
Oh, perfect 'o'
Touch the secret inside
You, babe
While our bodies shakin' so
Oh, the way you tease and
Please
It's only you i want to rock
And roll

Ooh, let it go
I hear you moan
Oh, perfect 'o'
Oh yeah
Perfect'o'
