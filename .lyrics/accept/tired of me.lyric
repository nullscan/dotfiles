Accept - Tired Of Me

(when it's your body way back the street)
But people have (__________)
And nobody wants you
(____) girl riding down highway
(driving) passing (by ________)
Got nobody i say

Chorus

Tired of me she's got my back to the wall
Tired of me there's nothing at all
Tired of me so i can't call
Laughing at (_____) you and your way
But give you freedom, that's what i say
I know, believe what i say

Chorus
