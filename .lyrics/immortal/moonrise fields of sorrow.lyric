Moonrise fields of sorrow
Our mighty fathers fell
Mountains watches memories
From a darkshining past
Layed in frost
Below a bleak sun
Under icicled paths
Mighty were the
Fathers of norsemen
And in us they shall return
Shine for me
Fields of sorrow
Shine for me dread moon
And make me
Neverending snowfall
Moonrise fields of sorrow
Layed in frost
Below a bleak sun
Under iced paths
Mighty were the
Fathers of norsemen
And in us they shall return
